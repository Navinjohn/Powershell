Objective:
This program will find the count of occurences values or elements that are present in the data and add it to the Dictionary.

Script:
Function = f(s) -> s = (string/list/None...)
r = {}             -> Empty Dictionary
for i in s:        -> For loop implementation to the s indices.
if i in r:         -> if condition to the r and i.
r[i] += 1          -> adding the 1 value to the Dictionary
else:              -> Else condition
r[i] = 0           -> adding the 0 value to the Dictionary
return r           -> returning the output of r 

Input:
s = list, string, NaN
r = {}

Output:
r = {'key':'count'}
