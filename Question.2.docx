Tell us about a scenario where you had to make changes to an existing Infrastructure-as-code setup to introduce a new change/fix a bug. 
What are the challenges you faced? 
How did you go about understanding other people's IAC code and modifying it?

I have used terraform to change the version of the sql server in the vm.
I imported the vm using the command terraform import vmname.vmid but i have faced an access issue so i checked the IAM and Security groups,
then i found that the ssh was blocked then i opened that port and resolved this issue.
I refer the documentation of the IAC code, also refer the commands in the code, i will modify it to modules so that it would be easy to read and 
use in the future.
